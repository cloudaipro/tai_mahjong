## Project Overview

This is a Taiwan Mahjong online game development project that has completed comprehensive architecture planning and is ready for implementation. The goal is to create an authentic 16-tile Taiwan Mahjong game with web and mobile versions that faithfully follows traditional Taiwan Mahjong rules.

**Current Phase**: Implementation-ready with complete architecture and MVP plan
**Status**: Ready for development team assembly and Phase 1 kickoff

## Key Architecture Context

**Full Product Architecture** (8-month timeline):
- **Multi-platform target**: Web (React.js + TypeScript), Mobile (React Native)
- **Backend**: Node.js hybrid modular monolith with DDD + Clean Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Redis with advanced caching strategies
- **Real-time**: WebSocket with custom protocol and network resiliency
- **Security**: ECDSA cryptographic security with 12-layer protection
- **Deployment**: Docker + Kubernetes with multi-region support

**MVP Architecture** (16-week timeline) - **CURRENT FOCUS**:

- Special rules and edge cases
- Visual guides and examples
- These files are essential for understanding authentic Taiwan Mahjong requirements

## Development Workflow

This project uses a PRP (Product Requirements Process) workflow:
- Templates located in `PRPs/templates/prp_base.md`
- Emphasizes context-rich documentation and validation loops
- Follow all rules specified in CLAUDE.md (this file)

## Development Guidelines

### Core Principles
1. **Taiwan Mahjong Rule Authenticity**: 100% faithful to traditional Taiwan 16-tile Mahjong rules (non-negotiable)
2. **Architecture Compliance**: Follow ADR decisions and architectural boundaries enforced by fitness functions
3. **MVP-First Approach**: Implement MVP scope before expanding to full product features
4. **Expert Validation**: All game logic must pass 4-layer testing including Taiwan Mahjong expert approval
5. **Cultural Authenticity**: Preserve Taiwan Mahjong terminology and cultural elements

### Implementation Guidelines
- **Reference Documentation**: Always check `reference/` for Taiwan Mahjong rules before implementing game logic
- **ADR Compliance**: Review relevant ADRs in `.architecture/decisions/adrs/` before making architectural changes
- **Performance Targets**: MVP targets are <100ms backend response, 60fps web, 30fps mobile web
- **Testing Requirements**: >95% test coverage for game logic, comprehensive scenario testing for edge cases
- **Security Standards**: Follow JWT + HTTPS security framework for MVP, prepare for future ECDSA enhancement
