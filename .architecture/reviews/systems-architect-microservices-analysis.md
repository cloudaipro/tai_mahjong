## Architecture Pattern Definitions

### Microservices Architecture
**Definition**: An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services that communicate over well-defined APIs.

```

│   Client    │    │   Client    │    │   Client    │
│  (Web/App)  │    │  (Web/App)  │    │  (Web/App)  │
└──────┬──────┘    └──────┬──────┘    └──────┬──────┘

### Client-Server Architecture (Monolithic)
**Definition**: A centralized architecture where clients communicate with a single, unified server application that handles all business logic.

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│   Client    │    │   Client    │    │   Client    │

## Comparative Analysis

### Microservices Architecture

#### ✅ **Advantages for Taiwan Mahjong**

1. **Scalability Granularity**
   ```
   Game Logic Service: Scale for complex rule calculations
   Real-time Service: Scale for WebSocket connections
   User Service: Scale for authentication load
   ```

2. **Independent Development & Deployment**
   ```
   Team A: Taiwan Mahjong rules engine (游戏逻辑专家)
   Team B: Real-time networking (网络通信专家)  
   Team C: User systems (用户体验专家)
   ```

3. **Fault Isolation**
   ```
   If Analytics Service fails → Games continue
   If Notification Service fails → Core gameplay unaffected
   If one Game Service instance fails → Other rooms continue
   ```

4. **Technology Diversity**
   ```
   Game Engine: TypeScript (complex logic)
   Real-time: Node.js (WebSocket optimization)
   Analytics: Go (high-performance data processing)
   ```

5. **Database Optimization**
   ```
   Game DB: Optimized for frequent reads/writes
   User DB: Optimized for profile queries
   Analytics DB: Optimized for time-series data
   ```

#### ❌ **Challenges**

1. **Distributed System Complexity**
   - Network latency between services
   - Service discovery and health checking
   - Distributed transaction management

2. **Operational Overhead**
   - Multiple deployment pipelines
   - Service monitoring and logging
   - Inter-service communication debugging

3. **Data Consistency**
   - Eventual consistency challenges
   - Cross-service transaction coordination
   - Service boundary design complexity

### Client-Server (Monolithic) Architecture

#### ✅ **Advantages**

1. **Simplicity**
   - Single codebase and deployment
   - Direct function calls (no network overhead)
   - Simpler debugging and testing

2. **Consistency**
   - ACID transactions across all data
   - Immediate consistency guarantees
   - Simpler data modeling

3. **Performance**
   - No inter-service network calls
   - Shared memory and resources
   - Lower latency for internal operations

#### ❌ **Disadvantages for Gaming**

1. **Scaling Limitations**
   ```
   Single Point of Failure: Entire system down if server fails
   Uniform Scaling: Must scale all components together
   Resource Waste: Over-provision for peak components
   ```

2. **Development Constraints**
   ```
   Team Dependencies: All teams work on same codebase
   Deployment Risk: Any change can affect entire system
   Technology Lock-in: Entire system uses same tech stack
   ```

3. **Gaming-Specific Issues**
   ```
   Real-time Performance: Mixed with non-critical operations
   Player Load Balancing: Difficult to optimize for game rooms
   Feature Isolation: New features risk breaking existing games
   ```

## Why Microservices for Taiwan Mahjong?

### 1. **Real-time Gaming Requirements**
```
Problem: Mixed real-time and batch operations in monolith
Solution: Dedicated real-time service optimized for WebSocket
```

### 2. **Scalability Patterns**
```
Traffic Pattern: 
- Game Service: High during gameplay hours
- User Service: High during login times  
- Analytics: Consistent background processing

Microservices allows independent scaling of each pattern
```

### 3. **Cultural and Technical Expertise**
```
Taiwan Mahjong Rules: Requires domain expertise
Real-time Networking: Requires technical expertise
Mobile Apps: Requires platform expertise

Microservices allows specialized teams for each domain
```

### 4. **Global Deployment**
```
Game Services: Deploy regionally for low latency
User Services: Global with data locality compliance
Analytics: Centralized for business intelligence
```

### 5. **Reliability Requirements**
```
Core Gaming: 99.9% uptime requirement
Analytics: Can tolerate brief outages
Notifications: Non-critical for gameplay

Different reliability requirements need different architectures
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Start with Modular Monolith
```typescript
// Single deployment with clear service boundaries
class GameService { /* Taiwan Mahjong logic */ }
class UserService { /* Authentication & profiles */ }  
class RealtimeService { /* WebSocket handling */ }

// Clear interfaces between modules
interface IGameService {
  createRoom(config: RoomConfig): Promise<Room>;
  processAction(action: GameAction): Promise<GameState>;
}
```

### Phase 2: Extract Critical Services
```
1. Extract Real-time Service (performance isolation)
2. Extract Game Service (scaling requirements)  
3. Keep User Service in monolith initially
```

### Phase 3: Full Microservices Transition
```
1. Extract remaining services based on scaling needs
2. Implement service mesh for communication
3. Add comprehensive monitoring and observability
```

---

## Systems Architect Recommendation

### **PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: PROGRESSIVE MICROSERVICES ADOPTION**

Start with a **modular monolith** that can evolve into microservices. This approach provides:

1. **Immediate Benefits**: Clear service boundaries and separation of concerns
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Avoid premature distribution complexity
3. **Evolution Path**: Natural migration to microservices as requirements grow

### **Key Success Factors**

1. **Service Boundaries**: Design clear interfaces from day one
2. **Data Ownership**: Each service owns its data exclusively  
3. **Communication Patterns**: Async messaging for non-critical paths
4. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability across all services

### **Taiwan Mahjong Specific Considerations**

```typescript
// Game Service must handle Taiwan-specific requirements
interface TaiwanMahjongService {
  validateTileAction(action: TileAction): ValidationResult;
  calculateScore(hand: MahjongHand): ScoreResult; // 台數計算
  resolveClaimPriority(claims: ClaimAction[]): ClaimResolution;
  handleFlowerReplacement(player: Player): ReplacementResult;
}
```

---

**Systems Architect Verdict**: Microservices architecture is the correct long-term choice for Taiwan Mahjong, but should be implemented progressively to manage complexity and risk.
