# ADR-003: Development Methodology Selection

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-08  
**Deciders**: System Architect, Development Team  
**Related ADRs**: [ADR-001](./ADR-001-modular-monolith-architecture.md), [ADR-002](./ADR-002-collaborative-architecture-security-performance.md)

## Context

Following the adoption of hybrid architecture (Command Pattern + State Machines + Request-Response + Selective Event-Driven) and collaborative security/performance enhancements, we need to select appropriate development methodologies for frontend and backend implementation that align with:

1. **Taiwan Mahjong Domain Complexity**: 16-tile rules, complex scoring system (台數計算), authentic terminology
2. **Performance Requirements**: <70ms response time, <25ms command processing
3. **Cross-platform Needs**: Web (React.js) and Mobile (React Native/Flutter)
4. **Hybrid Architecture Integration**: Command Pattern, State Machines, Request-Response patterns
5. **Security Integration**: ECDSA signatures, anti-cheat systems, encrypted communications
6. **Modular Monolith Approach**: Clear module boundaries with future microservice evolution potential

## Decision

We have decided to adopt the following development methodologies:

### Frontend: Component-based Architecture + Redux

**Primary Methodology**: React.js Component-based Architecture with Redux state management

**Technical Stack:**
- **Core Framework**: React.js 18+ with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit + Immer for immutable updates
- **Component Organization**: Container/Presentational pattern with React Hooks
- **Performance Optimization**: React.memo, useMemo, useCallback
- **Cross-platform**: Shared components between React.js and React Native

### Backend: Domain-Driven Design (DDD) + Clean Architecture

**Primary Methodology**: Domain-Driven Design combined with Clean Architecture principles

**Architecture Layers:**
- **Domain Layer**: Taiwan Mahjong entities, value objects, domain services
- **Application Layer**: Command/Query handlers with light CQRS separation  
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Repository pattern, external service adapters
- **Presentation Layer**: REST API controllers, WebSocket handlers

**DDD Implementation:**
- **Bounded Contexts**: Game Core, Room Management, User Management, Real-time Communication
- **Aggregates**: Game, Player, Room entities with consistency boundaries
- **Domain Events**: For selective event-driven features (chat, analytics, notifications)
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Authentic Taiwan Mahjong terminology (摸牌, 打牌, 吃碰槓胡, 台數)

## Rationale

### Frontend Methodology Selection

#### Component-based + Redux vs. Alternatives

**Evaluated Alternatives:**
1. **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Good for complex state but 5-10ms UI update overhead
2. **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: Insufficient for real-time gaming requirements
3. **Component-based + Redux**: 2-5ms UI update overhead, excellent domain mapping

**Selection Reasoning:**
- **Performance**: Meets <70ms response time target with 3-7ms total UI update cycles
- **Domain Alignment**: Redux actions map naturally to Taiwan Mahjong commands
- **Cross-platform**: High code reuse between web and mobile platforms
- **Command Integration**: Redux dispatch mechanism integrates seamlessly with backend Command Pattern
- **State Consistency**: Immutable updates with Immer prevent accidental mutations
- **Developer Experience**: Rich ecosystem, debugging tools, established patterns

### Backend Methodology Selection

#### DDD + Clean Architecture vs. Alternatives

**Evaluated Alternatives:**
1. **Hexagonal Architecture**: Good isolation but over-engineered for modular monolith (2-3ms overhead)
2. **Pure Clean Architecture**: Excellent structure but lacks domain expressiveness
3. **CQRS**: Powerful but unnecessary complexity for current scale
4. **DDD + Clean Architecture**: Perfect domain expressiveness with clean structure (1-2ms overhead)

**Selection Reasoning:**
- **Domain Expressiveness**: Natural Taiwan Mahjong terminology and concept modeling
- **Performance**: 10-28ms total command processing meets <25ms average target
- **Bounded Context Alignment**: Maps perfectly to modular monolith module boundaries  
- **Command Pattern Integration**: Application Services handle commands naturally
- **Security Integration**: Clean boundaries for implementing security layers
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with dependency inversion

## Integration Benefits

### Methodology Synergy

1. **Command Flow Integration**:
   - Frontend Redux actions → Backend Application Service commands
   - Type-safe interfaces with shared TypeScript definitions
   - Consistent command naming (摸牌 → MopaiAction → MopaiCommand → Game.executeMopai)

2. **State Management Alignment**:
   - Frontend Redux state mirrors backend domain model state
   - Domain events trigger frontend state updates via WebSocket
   - Aggregate state changes map to Redux state tree updates

3. **Cross-cutting Concerns**:
   - Security: Command signing at Redux middleware, validation at Application Service
   - Logging: Structured logging at architectural boundaries
   - Performance: Monitoring at method/component level boundaries

### Taiwan Mahjong Domain Benefits

1. **Authentic Implementation**:
   - DDD Ubiquitous Language preserves authentic terminology
   - Component naming reflects Taiwan Mahjong elements (MahjongTile, PlayerHand, ScoringPanel)
   - Business rules properly encapsulated in domain entities and services

2. **Complex Rule Handling**:
   - Domain Services for scoring engine (台數計算系統)
   - Specification Pattern for complex validation rules
   - Aggregate boundaries ensure game state consistency

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Team training on DDD + Clean Architecture concepts
- React/Redux advanced pattern workshops  
- Taiwan Mahjong domain knowledge transfer
- Project structure setup with architectural boundaries

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (Weeks 3-8)
- Domain model implementation with Taiwan Mahjong entities
- Redux store structure with game state management
- Application Services for command handling
- React component library (MahjongTile, GameBoard, PlayerHand)

### Phase 3: Integration & Optimization (Weeks 9-12)
- Frontend-backend command integration
- Performance optimization and testing
- Cross-platform component sharing
- Security layer implementation

## Performance Validation

### Targets and Measurements

**Frontend Performance Metrics:**
- Component render time: <2ms per component
