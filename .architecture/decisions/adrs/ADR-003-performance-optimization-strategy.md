**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-07  
**Reviewers**: Performance Expert, Technical Lead, Architecture Team  
**Decision Outcome**: Approved based on collaborative expert analysis and <70ms target validation

## Context and Problem Statement

Following performance analysis by our Performance Expert, the Taiwan Mahjong online game project requires advanced performance optimization strategies to achieve **<70ms response times** (exceeding the original <100ms requirement by 30%) while supporting **10,000+ concurrent users**. The hybrid architecture provides opportunities for targeted optimizations that maintain security while delivering superior user experience.

**Performance Challenges Identified:**
- Complex Taiwan Mahjong rule processing creates computational overhead
- Real-time multiplayer synchronization requires low-latency communication
- Cross-platform consistency demands optimized data transfer protocols
- High concurrency scenarios stress system resources
- Security measures must not compromise response time targets
- Caching strategies need gaming-specific optimizations

**Performance Requirements:**
- **Primary Target**: <70ms average response time for game actions
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 10,000+ simultaneous players
- **System Uptime**: >99.9% availability under load
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent performance across Web/Android/iOS
- **Scalability**: Linear performance scaling with infrastructure

---

## Decision Drivers

1. **Competitive Advantage**: <70ms response times provide 30% better performance than requirement
2. **User Experience**: Sub-70ms latency feels instantaneous to users
3. **Scalability Goals**: 10,000+ concurrent users validated through testing
4. **Security Integration**: Performance optimizations must work with security measures
5. **Multi-Platform Consistency**: Equal performance across all platforms
6. **Cost Efficiency**: Performance improvements should reduce infrastructure costs
7. **Future-Proofing**: Architecture should scale to higher user loads

---

## Decision: Multi-Level Performance Optimization Strategy

We will implement a **comprehensive performance optimization framework** with the following components:

### 1. Multi-Level Caching Architecture (HIGH Priority)

**Decision**: Implement L1 (Application) + L2 (Redis) caching with gaming-specific strategies.

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface CachingStrategy {
  L1_APPLICATION: {
    ttl: 1_000, // 1 second
    targets: ['game_state', 'player_hand', 'current_turn']
  },
  L2_REDIS: {
    ttl: 300_000, // 5 minutes  
    targets: ['room_info', 'player_profiles', 'scoring_tables']
  },
  L3_DATABASE: {
    optimized_queries: true,
    connection_pooling: true,
    read_replicas: true
  }
}
```

**Caching Targets**:
- **L1 Cache**: Active game states, current player hands, turn sequences
- **L2 Cache**: Room information, player statistics, Taiwan Mahjong scoring tables
- **Intelligent Prefetching**: Predict and cache likely next game states
- **Cache Invalidation**: Event-driven cache updates for consistency

**Expected Impact**: 40-60% response time improvement for cached operations

### 2. Binary WebSocket Protocol Implementation (HIGH Priority)

**Decision**: Replace JSON with optimized binary protocols for real-time communication.

**Protocol Design**:
```typescript
interface BinaryGameMessage {
  header: {
    messageType: uint8,    // 1 byte
    playerId: uint32,      // 4 bytes
    roomId: uint32,        // 4 bytes
    timestamp: uint64      // 8 bytes
  },
  payload: Uint8Array,     // Variable length
  checksum: uint32         // 4 bytes
}
```

**Optimization Benefits**:
- **50%+ Data Reduction**: Binary encoding vs JSON text
- **Faster Parsing**: Native binary deserialization
- **Lower Bandwidth**: Reduced network overhead
- **Compression**: Additional gzip compression on binary data

**Expected Impact**: 30-50% reduction in network latency

### 3. Taiwan Mahjong-Specific Performance Optimizations

**Decision**: Implement gaming-domain optimizations for Taiwan Mahjong rules processing.

**Game Logic Optimizations**:
```typescript
class OptimizedTaiwanMahjong {
  // Pre-computed lookup tables
  private static readonly SCORING_LOOKUP = new Map<string, number>();
  private static readonly VALID_COMBINATIONS = new Set<string>();
  
  // Optimized rule validation
  validateMove(command: GameCommand): ValidationResult {
    // O(1) lookup instead of O(n) calculation
    return this.SCORING_LOOKUP.get(command.signature) || this.computeAndCache(command);
  }
  
  // Parallel processing for complex calculations
  async calculateScore(hand: MahjongTile[]): Promise<TaiwanScore> {
    const [baseScore, multipliers, bonuses] = await Promise.all([
      this.calculateBaseScore(hand),
      this.calculateMultipliers(hand), 
      this.calculateBonuses(hand)
    ]);
    return this.combineScores(baseScore, multipliers, bonuses);
  }
}
```

**Taiwan Mahjong Optimizations**:
- **Pre-computed Scoring**: Lookup tables for common Taiwan scoring patterns (台數)
- **Optimized Hand Evaluation**: Parallel processing for complex win condition checks
- **Tile Matching Algorithms**: Efficient algorithms for 吃碰槓 validation
- **Memory Pool**: Reuse objects for tile and game state management

**Expected Impact**: 60%+ improvement in game logic processing time

### 4. Database Query Optimization Strategy

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive database performance optimizations.

**Optimization Measures**:
```sql
-- Optimized game state retrieval
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_game_rooms_active 
ON game_rooms (room_id, is_active, last_modified) 
WHERE is_active = true;

-- Player statistics aggregation
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW player_statistics AS
SELECT player_id, 
       AVG(final_score) as avg_score,
       COUNT(*) as games_played,
       MAX(last_played) as last_active
FROM game_history 
GROUP BY player_id;
```

**Database Optimizations**:
- **Connection Pooling**: Intelligent connection reuse with pgBouncer
- **Query Optimization**: Indexed queries for frequent operations
- **Read Replicas**: Separate read/write operations for scalability
- **Materialized Views**: Pre-computed statistics and aggregations
- **Partitioning**: Time-based partitioning for game history tables

**Expected Impact**: 50%+ database query performance improvement

### 5. Resource Management and Optimization

**Decision**: Implement advanced resource management for memory and CPU efficiency.

**Resource Optimizations**:
```typescript
class ResourceOptimization {
  // Object pooling for frequently created objects
  private tilePool = new ObjectPool<MahjongTile>(1000);
  private commandPool = new ObjectPool<GameCommand>(500);
  
  // Memory-efficient data structures
  private gameStates = new LRUCache<string, GameState>(10000);
  
  // CPU optimization
  private workerPool = new WorkerThreadPool(4); // Parallel processing
  
  async processCommand(command: GameCommand): Promise<CommandResult> {
    // Use pooled objects
    const pooledCommand = this.commandPool.acquire();
    
    // Parallel processing for heavy operations
    if (this.isHeavyCommand(command)) {
      return this.workerPool.execute(() => this.processHeavyCommand(command));
    }
    
    return this.processLightCommand(command);
  }
}
```

**Resource Management Features**:
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse expensive objects (tiles, commands, game states)
- **Memory Management**: LRU caches with intelligent eviction policies
- **CPU Optimization**: Worker thread pools for parallel processing
- **GC Optimization**: Minimize garbage collection pressure
- **Resource Monitoring**: Real-time resource usage tracking

**Expected Impact**: 30%+ reduction in memory usage and CPU overhead

### 6. Network and Communication Optimization

**Decision**: Implement advanced network optimization techniques.

**Network Optimizations**:
- **HTTP/2 Server Push**: Push critical resources before requested
- **WebSocket Compression**: Per-message deflate for text data
- **Connection Multiplexing**: Efficient connection reuse
- **Regional CDN**: Static asset distribution for global users
- **Edge Computing**: Processing closer to users when possible

**Expected Impact**: 25%+ reduction in network-related latency
