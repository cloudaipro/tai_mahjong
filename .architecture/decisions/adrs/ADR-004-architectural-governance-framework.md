# ADR-004: Architectural Governance Framework

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-08  
**Decision Makers**: Collaborative Architecture Review Team (5 specialists)  
**Related**: ADR-001 (Hybrid Architecture), ADR-002 (Security), ADR-003 (Methodology Selection)

## Context

During the collaborative architecture review, the team identified a critical need for automated architectural governance to prevent architectural drift as the team scales and the codebase grows. Without proper boundary enforcement, the modular monolith could degrade into a tightly-coupled system, making future microservices migration difficult.

The review team, led by System Architect Alex Chen, determined that manual code review alone would be insufficient to maintain architectural integrity across a 12-15 person development team over an 8-month project timeline.

## Decision

We will implement an **Architectural Governance Framework** with automated boundary enforcement through:

### 1. Architectural Fitness Functions
- Automated tests that verify architectural rules in the CI/CD pipeline
- Build failure if architectural constraints are violated
- Gradual implementation starting with critical boundary violations

### 2. Enhanced Code Review Process
- Pull requests crossing module boundaries require architect approval
- "Cross-Boundary" label for automatic architectural review flagging
- Mandatory ADR creation for significant architectural changes

### 3. Boundary Enforcement Rules
- Domain layer cannot depend on Infrastructure layer
- Modules communicate only via defined interfaces or domain events
- Clean Architecture dependency rule enforcement
- Bounded context isolation validation

### 4. Implementation Strategy
- Phase 1: Manual enforcement during code reviews
- Phase 2: Automated critical boundary checks
- Phase 3: Comprehensive fitness function coverage

## Implementation

```typescript
// Example Architectural Fitness Function
describe('Architecture Governance', () => {
  test('Domain layer should not depend on Infrastructure layer', () => {
    const violations = archUnit.classes()
      .that().resideInAPackage('domain.*')
      .should().onlyDependOnClassesThat()
      .resideInAnyPackage('domain.*', 'shared.*');
    
    expect(violations.evaluate()).toHaveLength(0);
  });
  
  test('Game module should only communicate with Billing via events', () => {
    const violations = archUnit.classes()
      .that().resideInAPackage('game.*')
      .should().onlyAccessClassesThat()
      .resideInAnyPackage('game.*', 'shared.events.*')
      .orAre(assignableTo(DomainEvent));
      
    expect(violations.evaluate()).toHaveLength(0);
  });
});
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- Prevents architectural drift during rapid development
- Maintains clean module boundaries automatically
- Reduces technical debt accumulation
- Enables confident microservices migration path
- Enforces team discipline at scale

### Negative
- Initial setup overhead for fitness function implementation
- Additional build time for architectural validation
- Learning curve for development team
- Potential false positives requiring rule refinement

### Risks
- Over-rigid rules could slow development velocity
- Fitness functions require maintenance as architecture evolves
- Team resistance to additional process constraints

## Compliance

- **Implementation Timeline**: Week 3-4 (Phase 1 Foundation)
- **Owner**: System Architect (Alex Chen)
- **Success Criteria**: Zero architectural violations in CI/CD pipeline
- **Review Schedule**: Bi-weekly fitness function effectiveness review

## Related Decisions

- Builds on ADR-001 hybrid architecture foundation
- Supports ADR-002 security boundary enforcement
- Complements ADR-003 methodology selection (DDD + Clean Architecture)
