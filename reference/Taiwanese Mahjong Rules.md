# Taiwanese Mahjong Rules (台灣麻將規則)

## Overview

Taiwanese Mahjong differs from many other Mahjong variants primarily by dealing 16 tiles to each player instead of the usual 13 (except the dealer who receives 17 to start). A winning hand (called **胡牌**, "Hu") contains **5 sets (melds) of three or four tiles plus a pair**, totaling 17 tiles. The sets can be sequences (called Chows) or triplets/quadruplets (Pungs/Kongs). The game also includes a replenishing "Dead Wall" with 16 tiles.

Players each aim to form a winning hand by drawing and discarding tiles in turn. Scoring is additive for each patterns or melds formed. The payment system is unique: for a self-draw win (self-picked winning tile), all three opponents pay the winner; for a win on a discard, the discarder alone pays the winner.

## 1. Tiles (144 total)

### 1.1 Regular tiles (136 tiles)

- **Suits** (each 36 tiles: four copies of each numbered tile 1-9):

  - **Characters (萬子/Wans/Cracks)**
  
  - **Bamboos (索子/Bamboos/Sticks)**
  
  - **Dots (筒子/Dots/Balls)**
  
- **Honor Tiles (28 tiles)**

  - Winds: East (東), South (南), West (西), North (北) — 4 tiles each
  
  - Dragons: Red (中), Green (發), White (白) — 4 tiles each

### 1.2 Bonus Tiles (8 tiles)

- Flowers: Plum (梅 - East), Orchid (蘭 - South), Chrysanthemum (菊 - West), Bamboo (竹 - North)

- Seasons: Spring (春 - East), Summer (夏 - South), Autumn (秋 - West), Winter (冬 - North)

Bonus tiles are immediately set aside and replaced by drawing another tile.

## 2. Game Setup

### 2.1 Determining Seat and Dealer (庄家)

1. Players randomly sit.

2. Extract East, South, West, North wind tiles, shuffle face down.

3. One player rolls three dice to decide who draws first.

4. According to dice sum, start counting counter-clockwise to determine seat allocation by drawing wind tiles; drawn wind tile decides player's seat (e.g., drawing "South" sits at South seat).

5. The player who draws East is seated as dealer (**庄家**), starting the round.

### 2.2 Building Walls

Each player forms two stacks of 18 tiles, creating a square **“wall”** (牌牆). The game is played counter-clockwise from the dealer.

## 3. Dealing Tiles

- Dealer rolls the dice to determine the starting point on the wall from which tiles will be drawn.

- The dealer draws 17 tiles (including the "starting tile" or "開門牌"); each other player draws 16 tiles.

- Drawing proceeds counter-clockwise in batches of 4 tiles (two stacks) per turn, repeating until all players have their tiles.

### 3.1 Drawing Starting Point Logic

- Dice sum corresponds to player's wall to start from:

  - 5,9,13,17 → player's own wall
  
  - 6,10,14,18 → right opponent’s wall
  
  - 3,7,11,15 → opposite player's wall
  
  - 4,8,12,16 → left opponent’s wall

- Starting tile drawn after counting stacks on the wall at the starting point.

## 4. Flower Tiles and Replacement (補花)

- After dealing, players check for flower tiles in their hand.

- Flower tiles are immediately revealed and placed face up.

- Players then draw replacement tiles from the back (dead wall) to maintain 16 tile hand size.

- If replacement tile is also a flower, continue replacing until no flower is drawn.

## 5. Gameplay Flow

1. **Starting**: Dealer plays first by discarding one tile.

2. Play proceeds counter-clockwise.

3. On a player's turn:

   - Draw one tile (摸牌).

   - Discard one tile (打牌).

4. Players can respond to another's discard by:

   - **吃牌 (Chow)**: Only next player in turn order can claim the discard to form a sequence.

   - **碰牌 (Pung)**: Any player can claim discard if they have two matching tiles.

   - **槓牌 (Kong)**: Form a set of four same tiles – can be declared by drawing the fourth tile or using discard if having three already.

5. Declared melds (Chow, Pung, Kong) must be displayed face-up.

6. Game continues until a player wins by forming a valid hand or a draw (no win) occurs.

## 6. Forming a Winning Hand (胡牌)

- A winning hand consists of:

  - Five sets (melds) — either:

    - **順子 (Chows)**: sequences of three consecutive numbers in the same suit.

    - **刻子 (Pungs)**: triplets of identical tiles.

    - **槓 (Kongs)**: sets of four identical tiles.

  - One pair (將眼) — two identical tiles as "eyes"

- Total tiles: 17 (including last drawn tile).

## 7. Special Moves Explained

### 7.1 吃 (Chow)

- Must be made with the discard from the player immediately before you.

- Forms a sequence of three connected tiles.

- Must place meld visibly on the table.

### 7.2 碰 (Pung)

- Can be declared from any player's discard.

- Form a triplet (three identical tiles).

- Meld shown openly.

### 7.3 槓 (Kong)

- Declared if drawing or acquiring all four identical tiles.

- Types:

  - **明槓 (Exposed Kong)**: Made by adding fourth tile to an exposed Pung (claimed from discard).

  - **暗槓 (Concealed Kong)**: Four identical tiles from your hand, kept concealed (face down).

  - **加槓 (Supplement Kong)**: Adding a fourth tile from self-draw to an already exposed Pung.

- After declaring Kong, player draws an additional replacement tile (補牌).

- 槓上開花 (Kong Flower): If the replacement tile allows immediate winning, extra bonus applied.

## 8. Declaring 聽牌 (Ready Hand)

- When a player’s hand is one tile away from winning, they are in 聽牌 (Ting).

- Some rule sets require declaration and restrict changing tiles after declaring Ting.

## 9. Winning Conditions

- **自摸 (Self-draw)**: Winning with a tile drawn by oneself. All opponents pay winner.

- **放槍 (Discard win)**: Winning by claiming another player's discard. Only discarder pays.

- If the wall is exhausted and nobody wins → **流局 (Draw game)**, dealer continues to be dealer.

## 10. Scoring and 台數 (Taiwanese Scoring Points)

- 台數 represent the "points" or "multipliers" associated with winning hands or melds.

- Common scoring patterns:

| Pattern         | Description                                             | 台數 (Points) |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| 自摸 (Self-draw) | Winning on self-drawn tile                              | +1            |
| 門清 (Concealed) | Winning without claiming any melds                      | +1            |
| 平胡 (All sequences and a pair, no exposed melds) | +1            |
| 大三元 (Big Three Dragons) | Having three triplets of 中、發、白                      | +8            |
| 小三元 (Small Three Dragons) | Two triplets + a pair of three dragons               | +4            |
| 大四喜 (Big Four Winds) | Four wind triplets or kongs                            | +8            |
| 碰碰胡 (Full triplets) | All triplets/kongs and a pair, no sequences               | +4            |
| 四暗刻 (Four concealed triplets) | Four triplets all concealed                           | +6            |
| 混一色 (Mixed one suit + honors) | All tiles from one suit plus honors                   | +3            |
| 清一色 (Pure one suit) | All tiles from a single suit (no honors)                  | +6            |
| 海底撈月 (Last tile self-draw) | Winning on the last tile in the wall                    | +1            |
| 天胡/地胡 (Heaven/Earth Win) | Dealer wins on initial deal or non-dealer wins first turn | +8            |

- The base point (底) is set before the game; total winning payment = base + 台數 × unit value.

## 11. Additional Rules and Special Situations

- **四歸西**: Avoid 4 consecutive discarded West wind tiles in initial round.
- **包牌**: Payment penalties for special hands (e.g., 清一色 (All one suit), 大三元).
- **十三么**: Special Mahjong hand with 13 unique terminals and honors, rare and sometimes considered unlucky.
- **詐胡**: False declaration of win; penalty involves paying other players.
- **大小相公**: Misdealing where player has more or fewer tiles than normal; penalties apply.
- **四槓和局**: Draw if four Kongs have been declared in total.
- **四風連和**: Draw if four consecutive discards of the same wind tile.
- **九么九和**: Draw if starting hand has nine or more unique terminal/honor tiles.

## 12. Summary

Taiwanese Mahjong is a rich and strategic game with unique features such as 16 tiles per player, the inclusion of flower tiles, and its particular scoring and payment system. Mastery requires understanding tile types, meld formation rules, special melds, and the flow of gameplay starting with seat assignment through to declaring wins and scoring.
