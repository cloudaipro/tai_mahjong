## Context and Problem Statement

Following comprehensive security analysis by our Security Specialist, the Taiwan Mahjong online game project requires enterprise-grade security measures to protect against gaming-specific threats, ensure data privacy compliance, and maintain user trust. The hybrid architecture (Command Pattern + State Machines + Request-Response + Selective Event-Driven) presents unique security challenges and opportunities.

**Key Security Challenges Identified:**
- Command injection vulnerabilities in game action processing
- State manipulation attacks through insufficient validation  
- Real-time communication security gaps in WebSocket handling
- Taiwan Mahjong-specific gaming exploits (tile visibility, scoring manipulation)
- Anti-cheat system requirements for competitive gaming
- Multi-platform security consistency (Web, Android, iOS)

## Decision Drivers

1. **Zero Critical Vulnerabilities Target**: Production environment must have zero critical security issues
2. **Gaming-Specific Threats**: Taiwan Mahjong requires specialized anti-cheat measures
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: GDPR, data protection, and gaming regulation compliance
4. **Performance Requirements**: Security measures must not compromise <70ms response targets
5. **Multi-Platform Security**: Consistent security across Web/Android/iOS platforms
6. **Long-term Maintainability**: Security architecture must evolve with threats
7. **Cost-Effectiveness**: 12-15% security investment for enterprise-grade protection

## Decision: Comprehensive Security Architecture Implementation

We will implement a **multi-layered security architecture** with the following core components:

### 1. Cryptographic Command Signing System (CRITICAL Priority)

**Decision**: All Taiwan Mahjong game actions will use cryptographic command signing.

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface SecureGameCommand extends GameCommand {
  readonly nonce: string;
  readonly signature: string; 
  readonly expiresAt: number;
  readonly previousCommandHash: string;
  
  validateSignature(publicKey: string): boolean;
  isExpired(): boolean;
  hasValidNonce(usedNonces: Set<string>): boolean;
}
```

**Rationale**:
- Prevents command injection and replay attacks
- Ensures command authenticity and integrity
- Enables tamper-evident command history for game replay
- Compatible with hybrid architecture patterns

### 2. Server-Side Game Logic Validation (HIGH Priority)

**Decision**: 100% server-side validation for all Taiwan Mahjong rules (摸牌, 打牌, 吃碰槓胡).

**Implementation**:
- **Taiwan Mahjong Rules Engine**: Complete server-side rule validation
- **State Machine Integrity**: Cryptographic state transition verification
- **Real-time Anti-cheat**: Behavioral analysis during gameplay
- **Score Calculation Security**: Multi-validator consensus for 台數 calculations

**Rationale**:
- Eliminates client-side manipulation possibilities
- Ensures fair gameplay across all platforms
- Provides authoritative game state management
- Enables sophisticated anti-cheat detection

### 3. Enhanced Real-time Communication Security

**Decision**: Implement TLS 1.3 + message-level encryption for WebSocket communications.

**Security Measures**:
- **TLS 1.3 Enforcement**: Minimum encryption standard
- **Message-Level Encryption**: Additional encryption layer for sensitive commands
- **Certificate Pinning**: Prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: DDoS protection with gaming-specific patterns
- **Connection Authentication**: JWT + device fingerprinting

### 4. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) System

**Decision**: Implement MFA for enhanced account security.

**Features**:
- **TOTP Support**: Time-based one-time passwords
- **SMS/Email Fallback**: Alternative verification methods
- **Device Registration**: Trusted device management
- **Risk-Based Authentication**: Suspicious activity triggers MFA
- **Session Management**: Secure token rotation and revocation

### 5. Comprehensive Anti-Cheat Framework

**Decision**: Deploy multi-layer anti-cheat system with behavioral analysis.

**Components**:
- **Statistical Analysis**: Win rate, scoring pattern, tile distribution analysis
- **Behavioral Monitoring**: Timing patterns, decision consistency analysis
- **Client Integrity**: Application hash verification, tamper detection
- **Real-time Detection**: ML-driven anomaly detection during gameplay
- **Escalation System**: Automated response to suspicious activity

### 6. Data Protection and Privacy Compliance

**Decision**: Implement GDPR-compliant data protection with encryption.

**Measures**:
- **Data Encryption**: AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary player information
- **Right to Deletion**: Automated data deletion with anonymization options
- **Audit Logging**: Complete security event audit trail
- **Privacy by Design**: Built-in privacy protection measures
