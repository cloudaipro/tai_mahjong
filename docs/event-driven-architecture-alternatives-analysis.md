## Detailed Analysis by Pattern

### Command Pattern vs Event-Driven for Game Actions

**Command Pattern Benefits:**
- **Reified method calls**: Actions become first-class objects that can be stored, queued, and serialized
- **Input configuration**: Easy to implement customizable controls for different players
- **Undo/Redo functionality**: Critical for move validation and game replays
- **Network synchronization**: Commands can be sent over network for multiplayer sync
- **Actor independence**: Same command can work on any game object (AI or player)

**Event-Driven Limitations:**
- **Asynchronous uncertainty**: Events may be processed out of order
- **Debugging complexity**: Event flow harder to trace than direct method calls
- **State consistency issues**: Multiple events can create race conditions
- **Performance overhead**: Event queuing and dispatching adds latency

**Implementation for Taiwan Mahjong:**
```typescript
// Command Pattern Example
interface GameCommand {
  execute(player: Player): void;
  undo(player: Player): void;
}

class PlayTileCommand implements GameCommand {
  constructor(private tile: Tile) {}
  
  execute(player: Player): void {
    player.playTile(this.tile);
    // Can be serialized and sent to other players
  }
  
  undo(player: Player): void {
    player.undoPlayTile(this.tile);
  }
}
```

### Request-Response vs Event-Driven for Real-time Features

**Request-Response Benefits:**
- **Synchronous communication**: Immediate feedback for player actions
- **Lower latency**: Direct method calls vs event queue processing
- **Simpler error handling**: Direct return values and exception handling
- **Easier testing**: Straightforward unit testing without event infrastructure
- **Better consistency**: ACID properties easier to maintain

**Event-Driven Limitations:**
- **Eventual consistency**: State changes may not be immediately visible
- **Complex error handling**: Errors in event handlers harder to propagate
- **Debugging difficulty**: Asynchronous event flow creates complex call stacks
- **Ordering issues**: Events may arrive out of sequence

**Use Cases Comparison:**

| Feature | Best Pattern | Reason |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Player authentication | Request-Response | Needs immediate validation |
| Room joining | Request-Response | Synchronous state update required |
| Tile playing | Command | Needs undo/redo and network sync |
| Score calculation | Request-Response | Must be immediate and consistent |
| Chat messages | Event-Driven | Async delivery acceptable |
| Statistics | Event-Driven | Non-critical, can be batched |

### State Machine vs Event-Driven for Game Flow Control

**State Machine Benefits:**
- **Explicit state modeling**: Game phases clearly defined (waiting, playing, scoring)
- **Invalid transition prevention**: Impossible to reach illegal game states
- **Predictable behavior**: Deterministic state transitions
- **Easier debugging**: Current state always visible and traceable
- **Concurrent states**: Multiple independent state machines can run simultaneously

**Event-Driven Limitations:**
- **Implicit state**: Game state scattered across multiple event handlers
- **Race conditions**: Multiple events can create inconsistent states
- **Complex validation**: Need additional logic to prevent invalid states
- **Harder to visualize**: Game flow not as clear from code structure

**Taiwan Mahjong State Machines:**

1. **Room State Machine:**
   - States: Waiting → Playing → Scoring → Finished
   - Transitions: PlayerJoined, GameStarted, RoundEnded, GameFinished

2. **Player State Machine:**
   - States: Waiting → Drawing → Thinking → Playing → Finished
   - Transitions: TurnStarted, TileDrawn, ActionChosen, TilePlayed

3. **Game Round State Machine:**
   - States: Shuffling → Dealing → Playing → Calculating → Finished
   - Transitions: ShuffleComplete, DealtComplete, PlayerWon, ScoreCalculated

## Industry Research Insights
