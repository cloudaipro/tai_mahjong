## 1. Meeting Summary

The kickoff meeting for the Taiwan Mahjong Online Game's collaborative architecture review was held. After a high-level overview of the proposed hybrid architecture by Alex Chen, each specialist presented their initial findings, questions, and concerns based on their review of the project documentation. A collaborative risk identification session followed, leading to a set of initial action items.

The overall sentiment is positive, with all architects agreeing that the chosen architectural direction is strong. However, several key areas require deeper investigation to ensure success.

## 2. Specialist Assessments & Key Discussion Points

### **Alex Chen (System Architect)**
*   **Assessment**: The modular monolith approach is the right starting point, offering a good balance of development velocity and future scalability. The integration of DDD and Clean Architecture provides a solid foundation.
*   **Key Points**:
    *   The boundaries between modules (e.g., `Game`, `Player`, `Billing`) seem logical but need rigorous definition to prevent coupling.
    *   The proposed event-driven communication for non-critical path events is good, but the exact mechanism (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, or a simpler in-process bus) needs to be decided.
    *   Observability is a major concern. We need to plan for distributed tracing from day one, even within the monolith, to make the eventual migration to microservices feasible.
*   **Questions Raised**:
    *   How will we enforce architectural constraints and prevent "architecture drift" as the team grows?
    *   What is our strategy for service discovery and configuration management, both now and in the future?

### **David Kim (Frontend Architect)**
*   **Assessment**: The React/React Native strategy is sound, and the proposed component structure is logical. The use of Redux for state management is appropriate for a game of this complexity.
*   **Key Points**:
    *   The goal of 60-70% code sharing is ambitious but achievable. We need to be disciplined about separating business logic (hooks) from presentation components.
    *   Performance on the 3D game board is a concern. WebGL is powerful but can be a performance bottleneck if not managed carefully.
    *   State synchronization logic between the client and server needs to be flawless. We need a clear strategy for handling latency, optimistic updates, and server-side corrections.
*   **Questions Raised**:
    *   How will we manage platform-specific UI/UX differences without cluttering the shared codebase?
    *   What is our testing strategy for the UI, especially for the complex game board interactions?

### **Lisa Wang (Game Systems Architect)**
*   **Assessment**: The documentation shows an excellent grasp of Taiwan Mahjong rules. The core domain model appears robust.
*   **Key Points**:
    *   The biggest challenge is ensuring 100% rule accuracy, especially for obscure edge cases (`過水`, `詐胡`, special draws). The rules engine must be heavily tested.
    *   The real-time state machine for the game loop is critical. It must be resilient to invalid commands and out-of-order events.
    *   The AI for bot players needs a well-defined architecture. Will it be a simple state-based model or something more complex? This will impact performance.
*   **Questions Raised**:
    *   How will we validate the fairness of the random tile distribution (shuffling)? This is crucial for player trust.
    *   What is the mechanism for updating game rules or scoring variations post-launch without requiring a full redeployment?

### **James Thompson (Data Architect)**
*   **Assessment**: The choice of PostgreSQL and Redis is solid. The proposed schema for storing game state and commands is a good starting point.
*   **Key Points**:
    *   Using the `game_commands` table as an event source is powerful for replays and audits, but it can grow very large. We need a data archiving or summarization strategy.
    *   The caching strategy needs more detail. What specific data goes into Redis? How do we handle cache invalidation, especially for active games?
    *   Data consistency between the PostgreSQL database and the Redis cache is paramount. A cache-aside pattern seems appropriate, but we need to define the implementation.
*   **Questions Raised**:
    *   How will we handle database schema migrations with zero downtime?
    *   What are the data requirements for the analytics and player behavior analysis mentioned in the PRD? This will impact the schema.

### **Sarah Patel (Mobile Architect)**
*   **Assessment**: React Native is a good choice for this project, but we must be proactive about mobile-specific challenges.
*   **Key Points**:
    *   Network resiliency is my biggest concern. Mobile connections are unstable. The app must handle frequent disconnections and reconnections gracefully without losing game state.
    *   Battery consumption is another key issue. The 3D rendering and constant WebSocket connection could drain batteries quickly. We need to profile and optimize this.
    *   The "feel" of the app must be native. This means paying close attention to touch targets, animations, and platform conventions (e.g., navigation, dialogs).
*   **Questions Raised**:
    *   What is our strategy for offline support? Can a user practice against a bot without a connection?
    *   How will we manage the size of the application bundle, especially with 3D assets?

## 3. Identified Risks (Initial List)

1.  **Performance (High)**: Meeting the <70ms response time and 60fps mobile rendering targets simultaneously is a significant challenge.
2.  **Mobile Experience (High)**: Failure to address network instability and battery drain could lead to a poor user experience on mobile.
3.  **Rule Accuracy (Medium)**: Any deviation from authentic Taiwan Mahjong rules will damage player trust.
4.  **Scalability (Medium)**: The modular monolith may accumulate technical debt that makes future scaling difficult if boundaries are not strictly enforced.
5.  **Data Growth (Low)**: The command/event log could become a performance and cost issue over time if not managed.
