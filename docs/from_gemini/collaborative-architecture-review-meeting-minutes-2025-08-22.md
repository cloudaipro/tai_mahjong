## 2. Meeting Summary

This meeting was held to review the outcomes of the action items defined in the kickoff session. Each architect presented their findings and drafted documents. The team discussed the proposed solutions, identified new considerations, and collectively agreed on the path forward. The architectural direction is now considered validated, and the project is ready to move into a detailed implementation planning phase.

## 3. Review of Action Items & Key Decisions

### **A-1: Architectural Governance** (Owner: Alex Chen)
*   **Document**: `docs/architectural-governance.md`
*   **Discussion**: The team unanimously approved the principles outlined in the document. The concept of "Architectural Fitness Functions" was well-received as a method to prevent architectural drift. The main point of discussion was the implementation cost.
*   **Decision**: The governance framework is **approved**. We will start by enforcing rules manually during code reviews and implement the automated fitness functions incrementally, beginning with the most critical dependency rules.

### **A-4: Data Caching & Invalidation** (Owner: James Thompson)
*   **Document**: `docs/data-caching-invalidation-strategy.md`
*   **Discussion**: The Cache-Aside pattern and Redis data structures were deemed appropriate. Lisa Wang raised a concern about the "thundering herd" problem if a popular game's cache expires and many users request it simultaneously.
*   **Decision**: The strategy is **approved** with one addition: a mechanism for proactive cache refresh. For games nearing their TTL, a background job will regenerate the cache just before it expires to prevent mass cache misses.

### **A-5: Client-Side Network Resiliency** (Owners: Sarah Patel, David Kim)
*   **Document**: `docs/client-side-network-resiliency-design.md`
*   **Discussion**: The design was praised for its thoroughness. The command queue with idempotent UUIDs was seen as a robust solution. The main discussion point was the 30-second grace period for disconnections. Alex Chen noted this could be abused.
*   **Decision**: The design is **approved**. The server will monitor frequent disconnections from players. If a player disconnects more than 3 times in a single game, the grace period will be removed for them for the remainder of that game to prevent rage-quitting abuse.

### **A-3: Game Rules Engine Test Plan** (Owner: Lisa Wang)
*   **Document**: `docs/game-rules-engine-test-plan.md`
*   **Discussion**: The multi-layered testing approach was met with strong approval. The scenario-based testing using JSON scripts was highlighted as particularly powerful. The only concern was the budget and timeline for securing and utilizing Mahjong masters for expert validation.
*   **Decision**: The test plan is **approved**. The project manager will be tasked with sourcing and budgeting for the expert review as part of the Phase 4 plan.

### **A-6: Initial Player Analytics** (Owners: James Thompson, Lisa Wang)
*   **Document**: `docs/initial-player-analytics-data-requirements.md`
*   **Discussion**: The team reviewed the proposed analytics framework. A significant discussion arose regarding whether this feature should be included in the initial product launch. While the benefits of early data collection were acknowledged, concerns about scope creep and focusing developer time on core gameplay were also raised. The cost-benefit of a self-managed PostgreSQL vs. a cloud data warehouse was also debated.
*   **Decision**: **TBD (To Be Determined)**. The final decision on whether to include the analytics framework in the initial launch is postponed. The topic will be revisited after the core game engine is further along and a clearer picture of the project timeline and budget is available.

### **A-2: 3D Game Board Proof-of-Concept** (Owners: David Kim, Sarah Patel)
*   **Status**: **Completed**.
*   **Report**: David and Sarah presented their findings from the PoC.
    *   **Web (Three.js)**: Achieved 60fps on modern desktops, but performance dropped on older laptops. Significant optimization will be needed for tile textures and lighting.
    *   **Mobile (React Native Skia)**: Achieved a stable 45-50fps on mid-range devices, but with simplified 3D models. Reaching a consistent 60fps will be the primary challenge.
    *   **Conclusion**: The 3D board is feasible on both platforms, but performance is a critical risk as predicted. A "Low-Fi" 2D mode should be considered as a fallback for low-end devices.

## 4. Final Architectural Approval

With all initial action items addressed and key strategies documented and approved, the collaborative review team formally **approves the proposed architecture**. The project has a solid, well-vetted foundation.

The review process successfully moved the architecture from a high-level concept to a set of detailed, actionable designs for its most critical components.

## 5. New Action Items (Transition to Implementation)

| ID | Action Item | Owner(s) | Due Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| B-1 | Create initial Jira tickets for the core application shell, incorporating the approved designs for governance, caching, and resiliency. | Alex Chen | 2025-08-29 |
| B-2 | Develop a "Performance Budget" for the 3D board, defining maximum polygon counts, texture sizes, and draw calls. | David Kim, Sarah Patel | 2025-09-05 |
| B-3 | Begin implementation of the Mahjong rules engine, starting with the unit test suite as defined in the test plan. | Lisa Wang | 2025-08-29 |
| B-5 | Design a "Low-Fidelity Mode" feature toggle that allows users to switch to a simpler 2D representation of the game board. | David Kim, Sarah Patel | 2025-09-12 |

## 6. Next Steps

The collaborative architecture review phase is now **concluded**. The project will transition into the **Phase 1: Foundation + Security** implementation stage. The architecture team will continue to meet on a bi-weekly basis to oversee implementation and review any new ADRs.
