## 1. Review Objectives

The primary goals of this architectural review are to:

1.  **Validate Architectural Soundness**: Critically assess the proposed hybrid architecture against the project's functional and non-functional requirements as defined in the PRD.
2.  **Identify Risks & Opportunities**: Proactively identify potential risks, performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, and scalability challenges.
3.  **Ensure Cross-Domain Alignment**: Guarantee that the system, frontend, game, data, and mobile architectures are cohesive, well-integrated, and aligned with a unified vision.
4.  **Refine Implementation Roadmap**: Solidify the architectural decisions and provide a clear, actionable roadmap for the development teams.
5.  **Foster Collaboration**: Create a shared understanding and collective ownership of the architecture across all specialist domains.

## 2. Scope of Review

### **In Scope:**

*   **Overall System Architecture**: The hybrid model combining a Modular Monolith with event-driven patterns.
*   **Backend Architecture**: The application of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture.
*   **Frontend & Mobile Architecture**: The cross-platform strategy using React.js and React Native, including state management with Redux.
*   **Game Systems Architecture**: The core game logic, state management, and adherence to authentic Taiwan Mahjong rules.
*   **Data Architecture**: Database schemas (PostgreSQL), caching strategies (Redis), and data flow patterns.
*   **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Security, scalability, performance, and observability across all layers of the stack.

### **Out of Scope (for this initial review):**

*   Detailed UI/UX pixel-perfect designs.
*   Marketing, monetization, or user acquisition strategies.
*   Long-term operational and maintenance plans (post-launch).
