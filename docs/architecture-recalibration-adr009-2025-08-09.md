## 2. Performance Recalibration

### **2.1 Performance Impact Analysis**

| Performance Area | Before (AI) | After (Rule-Based) | Improvement | Status |
|------------------|------------|-------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Decision Making** | 50-200ms (variable) | <25ms (guaranteed) | **75-87% faster** | ✅ Major improvement |
| **Memory Usage** | 500MB-2GB (models) | <50MB (rules) | **90-95% reduction** | ✅ Significant reduction |
| **CPU Utilization** | High (inference) | Minimal (logic) | **80-90% reduction** | ✅ Dramatic improvement |
| **Response Predictability** | Variable (0-500ms) | Deterministic (<70ms) | **100% predictable** | ✅ Complete control |
| **Cold Start Time** | 5-30s (model loading) | <500ms (rule loading) | **90-95% faster** | ✅ Near-instant startup |

### **2.2 Updated Performance Targets**

#### **Enhanced Performance Guarantees**
```typescript
// BEFORE: AI Performance (Variable)
interface AIPerformanceProfile {
  averageResponseTime: "50-200ms (depends on model size)";
  worstCaseResponse: "up to 500ms (complex inference)";
  memoryFootprint: "500MB-2GB (model dependent)";
  predictability: "low (model behavior uncertainty)";
}

// AFTER: Rule-Based Performance (Guaranteed)

  guaranteedResponseTime: "<25ms (99.9%ile)";
  hardTimeoutLimit: "70ms (absolute maximum)";
  memoryFootprint: "<50MB (YAML rules + runtime)";
  predictability: "100% (deterministic logic)";
}
```

  memoryPerInstance: "200-500MB",   // Model memory requirements
  scalingBottleneck: "inference_hardware"
};

// AFTER: Rule-Based Scalability
const ruleBasedCapacity = {
  maxConcurrentEvaluations: 1000,   // Lightweight logic operations
  memoryPerInstance: "2-5MB",       // Rule sets only
  scalingBottleneck: "none"         // CPU-bound, easily scalable
};
```
