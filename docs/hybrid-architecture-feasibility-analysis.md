## 1. Technical Feasibility

### ✅ **HIGHLY FEASIBLE**

**Implementation Complexity Assessment:**
- **REDUCED Complexity**: Command Pattern and State Machines are simpler than pure event-driven architecture for game logic
- **Perfect Integration**: Fits seamlessly with existing modular monolith plan

**Specific Technical Benefits:**
- **Command Pattern**: Ideal for Taiwan Mahjong actions (摸牌, 打牌, 吃碰槓胡) with action validation, network sync, and replay recording
- **State Machines**: Perfect for game flow (發牌→進行→結算) with invalid state prevention
- **Request-Response**: Lower latency for real-time features critical to <100ms requirement
- **Selective Events**: Maintains existing event bus for non-critical operations

**Integration with Modular Monolith:**
- Leverages existing module boundaries (game-engine, room-management, user-management)
- No additional technology stack changes required
- Enhances existing WebSocket and database architecture

## Detailed Analysis Sections

### A. Taiwan Mahjong Specific Considerations

**Game Rule Implementation Benefits:**
- **Command Pattern for Actions**: Each mahjong action (摸牌, 打牌, 碰牌, 槓牌, 胡牌) becomes a discrete command
