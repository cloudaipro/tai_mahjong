### Container Architecture Diagram - Detailed Explanation

**Purpose & Design Philosophy:**
The Container Architecture Diagram illustrates the physical deployment structure of the Taiwan Mahjong platform, showing how different logical components are packaged into deployable containers and how they communicate. This architecture follows a modular monolith approach with clear separation of concerns and independent scalability.

**Client Applications Tier:**
- **Web Application**: React.js-based Progressive Web App (PWA) providing desktop and mobile web experience with offline capabilities, service workers for caching, and responsive design for various screen sizes
- **Mobile Applications**: React Native apps for iOS/Android with platform-specific optimizations, native device integrations (camera, contacts, push notifications), and shared business logic with the web client

**Infrastructure & Load Balancing:**
- **Load Balancer (Nginx/HAProxy)**: Acts as the single entry point with SSL termination, request routing, health checking, and DDoS protection. Implements sticky sessions for WebSocket connections and distributes load across multiple application instances
- **CDN Integration**: Global content delivery network for static assets (game sprites, audio, UI assets) with edge caching, image optimization, and geographic distribution to minimize latency worldwide

**Application Tier - Modular Services:**
- **REST API Server**: Handles HTTP requests with JWT authentication, input validation, rate limiting, and API versioning. Processes game actions, user management, and business logic through well-defined endpoints
- **WebSocket Server**: Manages real-time bidirectional communication using Socket.io with room management, connection persistence, heartbeat monitoring, and automatic reconnection for game state synchronization
- **Game Engine**: Core Taiwan Mahjong logic processor handling rule validation, score calculation, AI decision-making, and game state management with deterministic execution and audit trails

**Data Tier - High Availability:**
- **PostgreSQL Cluster**: Primary/replica configuration with automated failover, read scaling, connection pooling, and backup management. Stores user data, game history, statistics, and configuration with ACID compliance
- **Redis Cluster**: Distributed caching system for session storage, game state caching, real-time data, and pub/sub messaging with high availability and automatic sharding
- **Object Storage**: S3-compatible storage for game assets, replay files, user uploads, and backups with versioning, lifecycle management, and cross-region replication

**Supporting Services:**
- **Authentication Service**: Centralized identity management with OAuth 2.0, multi-factor authentication, JWT token management, and integration with social login providers
- **Notification Service**: Handles email and push notifications with template management, delivery tracking, and multi-channel communication (SMS, in-app, push)
- **Analytics Service**: Real-time data processing for user behavior tracking, game metrics, business intelligence, and performance monitoring with data pipeline integration
- **Monitoring Stack**: Comprehensive observability with metrics collection, log aggregation, distributed tracing, alerting, and health checking across all containers

**Container Communication Patterns:**
- **Synchronous Communication**: Direct API calls between containers for immediate response requirements (game actions, authentication)
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Event-driven messaging through Redis pub/sub for non-critical operations (notifications, analytics)
- **Data Access Patterns**: Read/write splitting with primary database for writes and read replicas for queries, with intelligent routing based on data consistency requirements

**Critical Container Interactions & Connection Analysis:**

**Client-to-Infrastructure Flow:**
- **Web/Mobile Apps → Load Balancer**: HTTPS termination with SSL/TLS 1.3, HTTP/2 multiplexing, connection persistence for WebSocket upgrades, geographic routing optimization, and DDoS protection activation
- **Load Balancer → API/WebSocket Servers**: Intelligent routing with health check validation, sticky session management for WebSocket connections, request distribution algorithms (round-robin, least connections), and automatic failover on container failure

**Application Tier Inter-Container Communication:**
- **API Server ↔ Game Engine**: Synchronous REST calls for game action validation, asynchronous command queuing for complex operations, shared context through Redis, and transaction coordination for multi-step game operations
- **WebSocket Server ↔ Game Engine**: Real-time bidirectional communication through internal message queues, game state synchronization, player action broadcasting, and connection state management across server instances
- **API Server ↔ WebSocket Server**: Session validation sharing through Redis, user authentication propagation, room membership coordination, and cross-server messaging for global announcements

**Data Layer Access Patterns:**
- **Application Containers → PostgreSQL**: Connection pooling with pgpool-ii, read/write splitting for query optimization, transaction management for data consistency, and automatic reconnection handling during database failover
- **Application Containers → Redis**: Distributed cache access with consistent hashing, pub/sub messaging for real-time features, session sharing across container instances, and distributed locking for critical operations
- **Application Containers → Object Storage**: Direct S3 API calls for asset serving, multipart upload for large files, CDN invalidation triggers, and lifecycle management automation

**Supporting Service Integration:**
- **API Server ↔ Authentication Service**: JWT validation requests, user profile synchronization, authorization policy checks, and audit event logging for security compliance
- **Game Engine ↔ Notification Service**: Game event triggers for push notifications, email campaigns for user engagement, achievement unlocks, and social sharing prompts
- **All Containers ↔ Monitoring Stack**: Metrics export via Prometheus endpoints, structured log streaming to centralized logging, distributed trace span creation, and health check endpoint exposure

**Network Communication Security:**
- **Internal Network Isolation**: VPC private subnets for application containers, security groups for port-level access control, network ACLs for subnet-level filtering, and encrypted inter-service communication
- **Service Mesh Integration**: Istio sidecar proxies for service-to-service encryption, traffic policy enforcement, observability data collection, and circuit breaker implementation

**Container Scaling Coordination:**
- **Auto-Scaling Triggers**: CloudWatch metrics for CPU/memory thresholds, custom metrics for game session counts, application-specific metrics for queue lengths, and predictive scaling based on usage patterns
- **Deployment Orchestration**: Rolling updates with health check validation, blue-green deployment coordination, canary release management, and automatic rollback on failure detection

**Data Consistency & State Management:**
- **Stateless Application Design**: Session state externalized to Redis, database connection pooling, shared configuration through environment variables, and immutable container images
- **State Synchronization**: Redis pub/sub for cross-container messaging, database transactions for atomicity, eventual consistency patterns for non-critical data, and conflict resolution mechanisms

**Scalability & Resilience:**
Each container can scale independently based on demand patterns, with auto-scaling groups, health checks, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation. The architecture supports zero-downtime deployments and automatic failover mechanisms.

### Data Flow Diagrams - Detailed Explanation

**Purpose & Critical Importance:**
The Data Flow Diagrams illustrate how information moves through the Taiwan Mahjong system during critical operations. These diagrams are essential for understanding system behavior, identifying potential bottlenecks, ensuring data consistency, and designing proper error handling and recovery mechanisms.

**4.1 Game Session Data Flow Analysis:**

**Game Initiation Flow:**
The sequence begins when a player requests to join a game, triggering a complex orchestration of services. The Load Balancer routes the request to an available API server, which first validates the player's session in Redis cache for fast authentication. Upon validation, the system retrieves the complete player profile from PostgreSQL, including game preferences, statistics, and security settings. The API server then coordinates with the WebSocket server to establish a persistent real-time connection, while the Game Engine initializes the player's context and caches the current game state in Redis for rapid access.

**Real-time Action Processing:**
During gameplay, player actions (such as discarding a tile) flow through a carefully orchestrated validation pipeline. The WebSocket server receives the action and immediately forwards it to the Game Engine, which first retrieves the current game state from Redis cache to ensure context awareness. The Game Engine then applies authentic Taiwan Mahjong rules validation, checking for legal moves, turn order, and special conditions (過水, 搶槓, 詐胡). Upon successful validation, the system updates the game state in Redis cache and asynchronously logs the action to PostgreSQL for audit and replay purposes. The updated game state is then broadcast to all connected players via WebSocket.

**Score Calculation & Game Completion:**
When a win condition is detected, the Game Engine initiates the scoring calculation process using authentic Taiwan Mahjong台數 (tai) calculation rules. Final scores are computed and cached in Redis, while game results are persistently stored in PostgreSQL. The system broadcasts final results to all players and triggers asynchronous updates to player statistics and rankings.

**4.2 User Authentication Data Flow Analysis:**

**Multi-Modal Authentication Processing:**
The authentication system supports multiple authentication methods through a unified flow. Email/password authentication involves credential validation against encrypted storage, while OAuth flows redirect to third-party providers for verification. Biometric authentication utilizes device-specific security features. Successful authentication results in JWT token generation with appropriate claims, session storage in Redis for fast access, and token delivery to the client.

**Session Management & Security:**
Subsequent requests include JWT token validation with signature verification, expiration checking, and Redis session lookup for additional security context. Invalid or expired tokens trigger re-authentication workflows, while valid requests proceed with authorized business logic execution.

**4.3 Real-time Communication Data Flow Analysis:**

**Client-Side Resilience:**
The Command Queue on client devices provides crucial network resilience by buffering player actions during network instabilities. Commands are queued locally and transmitted when connectivity is restored, ensuring no game actions are lost during mobile network transitions or temporary disconnections.

**Load Balancing & Scaling:**
The WebSocket Load Balancer implements sticky sessions to maintain connection persistence while distributing new connections across multiple WebSocket server instances. This approach enables horizontal scaling while preserving real-time communication integrity.

**Game Processing Pipeline:**
The Game Manager coordinates room-level operations and routes commands to the appropriate Game Engine instances. Each command passes through a Validation Layer that applies Taiwan Mahjong rules before execution. The processed results flow through Redis Cluster for state management, PostgreSQL for persistence, and Message Queue for command ordering and transaction management.

**Data Consistency & Recovery:**
The Message Queue ensures command ordering and provides transaction-like behavior for game state changes. Redis Cluster maintains real-time state with high availability, while PostgreSQL provides authoritative source of truth for permanent data. This multi-tier approach ensures both performance and data integrity.

**Architectural Implications:**
These data flows demonstrate the system's ability to handle complex, stateful, real-time interactions while maintaining data consistency, performance, and resilience. The flows support the critical requirements of Taiwan Mahjong gameplay including precise rule enforcement, real-time multiplayer synchronization, and cultural authenticity in game mechanics.
